## Introduction

The **Gold Price Detection Model** aims to predict future gold prices using historical data and various machine learning algorithms. Gold prices are influenced by multiple factors, including market demand, economic indicators, geopolitical events, and currency fluctuations. By analyzing historical trends, this model attempts to provide accurate price forecasts that can help traders and investors make informed decisions.

## Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels (for statistical modeling)
- XGBoost (optional, for enhanced predictive capabilities)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GoldPriceDetectionModel.git
   cd GoldPriceDetectionModel
   ```

2. **Install required libraries:**

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
  python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows, use: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
```bash
  jupyter notebook
   ```
  Open the GoldPriceDetection.ipynb notebook to run the project.


## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset:** Ensure you have historical gold price data (e.g., daily or monthly prices) in a compatible format such as CSV. Load this dataset into the notebook.
2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the cells in the notebook to perform data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


## Key Steps in the Notebook:
* **Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
* **Feature Engineering:** Create new features based on date (e.g., moving averages, lag values) to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power.
* **Model Training:** Train the model using various algorithms, including Linear Regression, ARIMA, LSTM, and XGBoost.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
* **Forecasting:** Use the trained model to make predictions on unseen data.
